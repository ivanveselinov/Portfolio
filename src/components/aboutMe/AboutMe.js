             Fun Fact: Since I was about 10 years old, my focus has been on anything to do with computers! I taught myself how to fix and program computers.
            <p> I spent ten long years working as a store owner who owned a fruit and vegetable business in the bazaar in Macedonia, whilst I worked hard at completing my university studies. My side business was working as an IT technician.

 I spent ten long years working as a store owner who owned a fruit and vegetable business in the bazaar in Macedonia, whilst I worked hard at completing my university studies. My side business was working as an IT technician.
  
 After coming to Australia and working in the Construction Cleaning industry and completing a Masters in Information Technology, I decided that it was time to follow my dreams and find a suitable dream job in Information Technology. I really didnâ€™t want my studies to be given up when I could have a prosperous job doing what I really enjoy and what I am really passionate and dreaming about. This is why I decided to put time into following my passion and began a course at General Assembly focusing in Full-Stack development.
  
 I am passionate about working with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Ruby, plus I am an honest, loyal and confident hard worker. I enjoy working as part of a team and thrive from collaborating with others. I am also always happy to learn new things and constantly educate myself on new and advanced technology.
  
 Specifically, I am searching for a role where I can utilise my Full-Stack developer (front end and back end) skills and also my Web developing and IT Technician skills, and I am currently available for new projects (whether local or international).            </p>
